## Flower Datasets

### Oxford Flower Datasets

We have created two flower datasets by gathering images from various websites, with some supplementary images from our own photographs. The first dataset is a smaller one consisting of 17 different flower categories, and the second dataset is much larger, consisting of 102 different categories of flowers common to the UK.
